--Labyrinth--

//The sales pitch:
A modern take on the classic boardgame. Navigate the ball through
the labyrinth, while avoiding the sink holes, using your android
devices built in motion sensors.

//The developers description:
Navigate the ball through a predetermined map, making use of the
motion sensors in the android device for steering. If the ball
hits one of the "sink holes" the user has lost the game and can
try again. If the ball makes its way through the entire labyrinth
and hits the "final hole", the map is cleared and a time is set
for this particular map. The user can then choose to retry the
map, to try and get a better time, or go on to play a different
map.

The times for each map are sorted and the lowest times for every
map is shown in a "highscore list". The user will be able to
erase the highscore data, to start all over again with setting
times.

Sounds will play when the ball interacts with a different object,
as in a wall, a sink hole or the final hole. Vibrations might also
occur at these moments.
