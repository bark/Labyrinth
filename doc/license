We have chosen to use the GNU GPLv3.
Our game will probably be in a playable version when finishing this course, but
not with too many fancy functions due to the time limit. Therefor, along with
our intention of wanting to release it for free, we would like to give others
the opptortunity to continue the development of our game. But, we still want it
to be free and open as when we released it, so that we ourselves can learn from
contributions by others and let the flow of releasing the source for free
continue.
