We have chosen to use the GNU GPLv3.

Our game will probably be available in a playable version when this course is
finished. However, it will most likely not contain too many "fancy" functions,
as there is a clear time limitation. Therefore our intention is to
release this application for free, along with the opportunity for others
to continue the development of the application.

Since our goal for this application is for it to be free, we want to enforce
others to release it for free aswell. This will keep the "flow of free software"
going, without anyone to claim it as their own or earning money off of other
peoples work. There is also a personal gain from this, getting to know how our
application can continue its development and learn from other peoples ideas.
